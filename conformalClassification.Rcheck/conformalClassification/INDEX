CPCalibrationPlot       Plots the calibration plot
CPEfficiency            Computes efficiency of a conformal predictor,
                        which is defined as the ratio of predictions
                        with more than one class over the size of the
                        testset
CPErrorRate             Computes error rate of a conformal predictor,
                        which is defined as the ratio of predictions
                        with missing true class lables over the size of
                        the testset
CPObsFuzziness          Computes observed fuzziness, which is defined
                        as the sum of all p-values for the incorrect
                        class labels.
CPValidity              Computes the deviation from exact validity as
                        the Euclidean norm of the difference of the
                        observed error and the expected error
